      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census Version TIGER/Line&#8482; files (CD&#8211;ROM edition).  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>How GDT Creates These Files: The data included in the boundary files was extracted from the 2000 Census Version TIGER/Line files (CD&#8211;ROM edition). Once extracted, the County, Tract, and Block Group information was edited as one database, assuring that they have perfect overlay characteristics where appropriate. When all editing was complete, the different layers were separated into products.</procdesc>
