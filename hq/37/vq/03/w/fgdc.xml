        <procdesc>This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The sectional maps were updated during 1978&#8211;1981 and digitized in the early 1980's.  The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale and 1:2,000,000-scale Bureau of Land Management State base maps.  These data were published on CD&#8211;ROM in 1995. Using ARC/INFO software, the DLG optional format files were converted to ARC/INFO coverages using the DLGARC command.  Only linear federal land features and attribute information were extracted for inclusion. The individual State coverages were then merged together using the ARC/INFO command APPEND.  The resulting data set was ATLAS-FEDL (Federal Land Features of the U.S. (linear)).

Using ATLAS-FEDL the spatial and attribute data were updated using the Wild and Scenic Rivers web site. The spatial data was integrated with ATLAS-HY (Hydrography Features of the U.S.) and ATLAS-RD (Major roads and trails of the U.S.).

        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was originally extracted from the individual 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey which have a positional accuracy of 1,720 meters.  It was updated several times using various sources whose horizontal positional accuracies are unknown.</horizpar>

    <logic>No duplicate features are present.  The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials. Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.</complete>
