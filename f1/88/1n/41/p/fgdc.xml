    <descript>
      <abstract>U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) represents five-digit ZIP Code areas used by the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail more effectively. The first digit of a five-digit ZIP Code divides the United States into 10 large groups of states numbered from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in the far West. Within these areas, each state is divided into an average of 10 smaller geographic areas, identified by the second and third digits. These digits, in conjunction with the first digit, represent a sectional center facility or a mail processing facility area. The fourth and fifth digits identify a post office, station, branch or local delivery area.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) provides area, postal district name, and demographic information for the ZIP Code areas in the United States.</purpose>

        <horizpar>Horizontal positional accuracy is dependent on geographic area. In most areas, accuracy is between 5 and 25 meters (16 and 82 feet). In some areas, accuracy is off by up to several tens of meters (100 feet or more). In the poorest areas, accuracy is off by up to 100 meters (328 feet).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the data set from TomTom MultiNet v. 2012.12. Removed any Canada and Mexico records. Attached and formatted the fields from 2010 Census Summary File 1 and Esri Data. Added the SQMI field and calculated its values. Deleted the fields POP2000 and POP00_SQMI. Added the field POP2012 and added and calculated the field POP12_SQMI. Put "-99" values into all number type fields (except SQMI) for records where there were no data. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS&#174; layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
