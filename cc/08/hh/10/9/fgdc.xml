      <abstract>This feature class contains land parcel boundaries delineated for property tax
        assessment purposes. Parcels are modeled as planimetric polygons in a seamless fabric
        comprising the spatial extent of the County of Kern, in the State of California, as of
        2009.</abstract>
      <purpose>This data is intended to provide a reasonable representation of parcels, as defined
        for property tax assessment purposes, that can be used easily in a computerized geographic
        information system. Includes all private (taxable), state utility, and other governmental
        (tax exempt) land interests listed on the secured tax roll, but does not include segregated
        mineral rights, mobilehomes, or unsecured taxable entities. This data is not intended to
        replace the hardcopy assessment maps or any other official or unofficial county maps, and it
        is not to be construed as portraying legal ownership or divisions of land for purposes of
        zoning or subdivision law.</purpose>

    <datacred>This dataset was originally compiled by the Kern County Assessor, in May 2001, from
      two different sources. The Kern Council of Governments provided the VWGIS data for the entire
      county; the City of Bakersfield provided the original COBGIS data for the metropolitan
      Bakersfield area, and continues to share data on an ongoing basis.</datacred>

  <dataqual>
    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Attribute values are originally hand-typed into the system during normal daily
        updates, and are therefore prone to error. APN values are rigorously tested using various
        procedures designed to detect as many errors as possible, so most errors are corrected
        before the data is released. Even though it is not possible to guarantee 100% accuracy (due
        to the nature of the data as well as human factors and process limitations), we are
        confident that the attributes contained in this dataset are represented with a very high
        degree of accuracy overall.</attraccr>
      <qattracc>
        <attraccv>APN</attraccv>
        <attracce>APN attribute values are believed to be about 99.99% accurate (or better). They
          are rigorously tested in several quality-control procedures on a regular basis. The only
          error type that cannot be detected by our automated quality-control procedures is a rare
          instance of two parcels having valid APN values reversed. This type of error is extremely
          rare, but it has been detected on several occasions. The only method of detection (that we
          know of) is by deliberate human scrutiny of the GIS parcels compared with the official
          assessor maps. Such scrutiny is too tedious and time-prohibitive to be practical with such
          a large dataset, therefore the exact number of errors of this type is unknown, and our
          estimate of accuracy is based on our past experience and frequency of encounters. The
          8-digit APN is sufficient to identify any tax parcel, but it lacks the extra check-digit
          necessary to join/link to the assessor's tax roll database. The 8-digit APN attribute is
          provided for those users who would like to join/link to their own databases which may be
          populated only with 8-digit APN values.</attracce>
      </qattracc>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Topological integrity (the spatial coincidence of vertices along the edges of adjacent
      features) is believed to be excellent, although not perfect. All data is maintained as a Line
      feature class with topology rules enforced. The APN attribute is stored in a centroid (Point)
      feature class. Geoprocessing tools are used to generate polygons from the lines, which are
      then spatially joined with the points to transfer the APN attributes to the polygons, which
      are then tested with a series of Error Detection and Correction (EDC) procedures. EDC is
      designed to test line integrity, line attributes, point attributes, and line topology before
      polygons are even created. Then, after polygons are created, the polygons are tested for
      overlaps, slivers, APN database parity, and centroid parity. There is a specific type of
      logical topology error that has been observed, but cannot be tested with EDC procedures. This
      type of error manifests as two adjacent parcels separated by a thin sliver that joins with a
      road or canal corridor at one end. This type of gap is difficult to find and correct because
      it does not form a closed loop or boundary, and therefore does not generate a polygon sliver
      that can be discovered based on its own characteristics or non-parity with other objects. The
      exact number of such gaps is not known, but is believed to be very small based on our own
      observations. The width of such a gap is also believed to be very small, likely well under 1
      foot per occurrence.</logic>
    <complete>This parcel shapefile is believed to be 100% complete, but completeness is not
      guaranteed. The assessor's tax roll database is used as the authoritative object in the
      process of testing the GIS parcel polygons for completeness. Unfortunately, its schema is
      highly complex, it is inadequately documented, it suffers from certain legacy data conversion
      issues, and it endures poor data entry standards, resulting in certain ambiguities and
      limitations in the data. It also contains many different types of taxable entities, including
      those that correspond to mapped parcel boundaries, but also including business properties and
      equipment, aircrafts, boats, mobilehomes, and various other entities that are assessed for
      taxes yet do not correspond to mapped parcel boundaries. Since only a subset of these taxable
      entities are modeled in this GIS dataset as mapped parcel boundaries, a query has been devised
      by the assessor's mapping staff to filter the database to produce a suitable recordset that
      can be subsequently joined/linked to the parcel polygons modeled in this GIS dataset. The
      query has been reasonably well researched and designed in order to extract all possible
      records which should theoretically be represented by mapped parcel polygons, but for the
      reasons stated above we cannot guarantee 100% completeness. After filtering the tax roll
      database, a two-part "parity test" is performed: The first part compares the tax roll database
      to the parcel polygons, to detect APN values that exist in the tax roll database but are in
      fact missing from the polygon dataset. The second part compares the parcel polygons to the tax
      roll database, to detect polygons having APN values that are invalid (due to data entry errors
      and APN value changes that failed to get applied). These errors and omissions are then
      corrected and the parity test is performed again, until all possible corrections have been
      made and perfect parity is achieved between the parcel polygons and the tax roll
      database.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Positional accuracy varies by region, usually about 10 feet or better in urban
          areas, and up to 50 feet (or more) in the mountains and other rural areas where horizontal
          control is less reliable due to poor availability of geodetic or survey data. Horizontal
          control is provided primarily by the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) comprised of
          Townships, Ranges, and Sections. PLSS datasets are provided by the Kern County Department
          of Engineering and Survey Services (ESS). Parcels are always created and maintained in
          direct relation to the PLSS control data, which is also subject to errors and
          inaccuracies, so the accuracy of the parcels can only be as accurate as the section
          corners that they are tied to. This dataset does not contain any attributes or other
          indications of positional accuracy. It was compiled by the assessor's staff from two
          different sources in 2001. Since both of the original data sources contained widespread
          accuracy problems, some parcels are misrepresented in geometric shape for various reasons.
          The assessor's staff is continually improving the accuracy and overall data quality. Three
          essential aspects of accuracy for tax assessment purposes include 1) the number of
          segments comprising a parcel's boundary and each segment's length and angle according to
          legally recorded source documents; 2) modification of a parcel's boundary due to
          encumbrances such as roads, canals, and easements that affect the property owner's fair
          use of the property; and 3) the position of a parcel boundary relative to benchmark
          features having known coordinates (such as section corners). The assessor's geodatabase
          actually contains quality codes which are used by mapping staff in the production process,
          but those codes are not transferred to this polygon dataset, which is a derivative
          product. The exact number of parcels that are geometrically misrepresented (shaped
          incorrectly) is unknown, but approximately 15 percent of the line segments are known to be
          reasonably accurate and the accuracy of the remaining 85 percent is unknown.</horizpar>

      <fees>$80 for direct orders (waived for govt. agencies). Internet download is free.</fees>
      <ordering>Due to our privacy policy, and pursuant to Govt. Code Sec. 6254.21, the Kern County
        Assessor's Office does not post property owners' names on the Internet. This policy also
        applies to the GIS Parcel Data. Because of this limitation, the data is available in two
        different packages: WITH PROPERTY OWNERS' NAMES or WITHOUT. The two packages are otherwise
        identical in content. Either package can be obtained by anyone, using either of the
        following methods: 1. DOWNLOAD FOR FREE - WITHOUT PROPERTY OWNERS' NAMES. Download
        compressed data files from http://www.co.kern.ca.us/gis. Data at this Internet site is
        available FREE OF CHARGE. As indicated above, property owners' names are not included with
        the version posted on the public Internet site. If you want property owners' names included,
        you must order the data directly from the Kern County Assessor's Office as described below:
        2. ORDER DIRECT FOR $80 - WITH PROPERTY OWNERS' NAMES. Order the GIS PARCEL DATA from the
        Kern County Assessor's Office, by mail, e-mail or phone. Available editions are described in
        the 'Resource Description' section of this document, above. Data may be provided by e-mail
        as private download links, or by CD-ROM. Send a check or money order in the amount of
        $80.00, made payable to 'County of Kern'. Shipping and handling are included (there is no
        additional charge). Credit cards are not accepted. Requests will not be fulfilled until
        payment is received. If you represent a government agency, the $80 fee may be waived (at our
        discretion). Send payment to: KERN COUNTY ASSESSOR ATTENTION: MAPPING 1115 TRUXTUN AVENUE
        BAKERSFIELD, CA 93301</ordering>
      <turnarnd>Direct orders are usually processed immediately upon receipt of payment.</turnarnd>
