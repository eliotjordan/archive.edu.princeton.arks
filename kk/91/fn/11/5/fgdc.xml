      <abstract>U.S. Geographic Names Information System Building represents an automated inventory of the proper names and locations of physical and cultural geographic features located throughout the United States and its Territories.</abstract>
      <purpose>Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), of which U.S. Geographic Names Information System Building is a part, promotes geographic feature name standardization and serves as the Federal Government's repository of information regarding feature name spellings and applications for features in United States and its Territories. The names listed in the inventory can be published on Federal maps, charts, and in other documents.  The feature locative information has been used in emergency preparedness, marketing, site-selection and analysis, genealogical and historical research, and transportation routing applications.</purpose>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) contains name and locative information about almost 2 million physical and cultural features located throughout the United States and its Territories.  GNIS was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.  GNIS is being compiled in phases.

The first phase is complete for the entire United States, and entailed the collection of names from Federal sources including large-scale USGS topographic maps, Office of Coast Survey charts, U.S. Forest Service maps, and digital datasets distributed by the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These data are compared to the records of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

The second phase of data collection is complete or in progress for about 80% of the United States, and captures names from State, locally, and other published current and historical maps, charts, and texts.

GNIS Maintenance program--Maintenance cooperators feed GNIS new names and corrections discovered in the course of new mapping and revision activities and implementation of the national geographic names standardization program.

In both processes, a random sample of 10% of the entries in the system were visually verified against the compilation source data (large-scale USGS topographic maps) to ensure an attribute accuracy rate of at least 95%. Locative references (geographic coordinates, topographic map, and county) were crosschecked for logical consistency.
