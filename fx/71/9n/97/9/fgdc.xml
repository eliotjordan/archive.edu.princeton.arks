      <abstract>The parcel feature class is a polygon feature class representing the individual
        parcels for Butte County, California, 2009, which was derived from assessor map pages in
        digital and hardcopy formats. All new parcels are entered from assessor CAD pages registered
        to orthorectified imagery.</abstract>
      <purpose>For use with GIS software. This layer is designed as a Tax Parcel product. This
        information is intended for cartographic use, general spatial analysis and as a spatial
        index to Land related information. It is not intended for site specific analysis.</purpose>

        <srccontr>BCAG contracted with the consulting firm Quad Knopf Engineering, Inc., to take
          BCDDS&#146;s countywide parcel file and improve its spatial accuracy by rectifying it to
          BCAG&#146;s highly accurate centerline road file. Also, base was brought up-to-date by
          adding missing parcels.</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The process for the parcel file cleaning was made up of four (4) phases that
          resulted in a more accurate parcel layer. The four phases consisted of: 1) importing or
          digitizing page; 2) cleaning; 3) registering; 4) implementing. The first phase in the
          adjustment process began with the importing of the Assessor CAD pages. The County Assessor
          maintains its pages as AutoCAD drawings (.dwg files). The prevailing factor in using the
          Assessors&#146; CAD drawings is to maintain the parcel pages&#146; scale and geometric
          accuracy. Each CAD drawing received from the Assessors&#146; Office was generated using
          Coordinate Geometry (COGO), which allows for accurate segment lengths and scale. Relevant
          layers from each CAD drawing are delineated and imported into an ArcInfo coverage.
          Important layers consist of lots, easements, roads, and parcels. If the CAD page was not
          available from the Assessor then the page needed to be manually digitized. Each paper
          parcel page was scanned at 300 dpi and converted to a vector format using heads-up
          digitizing. This work was subcontracted with ETS Digital in Chico. In order for the GIC to
          make the appropriate adjustments, all Assessor parcel pages need to be in digital format
          with parcel boundary lines digitized as a single vector layer in DWG file format. Thus,
          approximately 1,200 assessor parcel pages needed to be scanned, and the vector lines
          representing parcel boundaries needed to be extracted and saved as a DWG file. ETS scanned
          each Assessor parcel page, and digitized only the parcel boundary vector lines (no rivers,
          easements, etc), and were saved as a single DWG file. The parcel boundary vector lines
          were the only lines to be digitized as part of this contract. Page breakdown: Chico 303
          pages, Oroville 176 pages, Paradise 376 pages, Butte County and remaining areas 371.
          Unfortunately the CAD parcel page drawings&#146; topology (connectivity, area definition,
          and contiguity) from either the Assessor or ETS sometimes contained errors that would not
          allow the newly created Arc coverage to work correctly with the ArcInfo GIS master
          coverage. The most frequent example of this was lines/arcs that cross one another without
          actually connecting at the point of intersection. To correct this discrepancy, the clean
          command was used. This command: corrects geometric coordinate errors, assembles arcs
          (lines) into polygons and creates feature attribute information (shape/area/length) for
          each polygon or arc. A two-foot tolerance was used for this process. Essentially the end
          point of any arc/line was connected or snapped to another arc that was within a two-foot
          radius. After the clean operation was performed, a GIS technician manually rechecked each
          newly created parcel page coverage for any topological errors. If there were any errors
          found, the technician used ArcEdit to correct any remaining errors. Following the import
          and clean procedures was the registration phase. During this stage, the newly created and
          cleaned Arc coverages were registered using ArcGIS. Registration changes the Arc coverage
          coordinates using a projective transformation based on a set of control points. This
          process basically designated a real world location for the parcel page coverage. The real
          world location was referenced to an ortho-rectified aerial photo of the area and control
          points were derived. Control points are specific locations on the photo such as fence
          lines, intersections, and sidewalks. Once the parcel page coverage had been moved to
          its&#146; relative real world location, the rotate function was used to properly align the
          new page to the county master GIS coverage and aerial photo. Since the original AutoCAD
          drawing file was created with the appropriate scale, the coverage did not require any
          further scaling. After the newly created parcel page coverage had been registered, it was
          ready to be implemented. The implementation stage consisted of weaving the registered
          parcel pages into one master GIS coverage for the entire county within ArcEdit. The
          technician used his/her best judgment when sorting out discrepancies among pages. In
          addition to creating a master coverage that consisted of arcs/lines and nodes/points of
          connection, label points were created or updated as well.</procdesc>
